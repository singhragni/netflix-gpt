# Creating Netflix api -
- netflix sign- sign-up page
- if authentication is done then go browser 
 browser
 - header 
 - video play 
 - then diplac pic 



 # login form


# For From u can use 
Formic library-



# Form validation
- useRef Hook



# Button 
 when you create a button and try to submit(click) it refresh the page .
 - for that issue create onSubmit button and and handle add preventDefault


# Difference between useState and useRef


# hoisting 
- hoisting in firebase 
- comannd for node js 
- npm install -g firebase-tools


# now sign up is done 
# sign is also 
# using sign in go on browser page 
- so for that we will redux 
- will make slice for that 
- use it where we want to use it.


#redux store    `4
- @reduxjs/toolkit
- react-redux
- create our store 
- create our user slice 
- and provide store in app

# tasks01 
- when we sign in then store data in slice .
- when we sign out then remove data from slice.
- agian again use dispatch then firebase provide u 
onAuthStateChange.


# task02
- we are navigating to Browse page when sign in 
- we are navingating to homw page when sign out 
Solution - is navigator in reacvt-router-dom 
2. is window.location.href("/)


# Difference between Link and Navigate .
 - link use when u want browse to static page.
 - use navigate when we used u want to do some logic then call it 
 - like and event
 

# task 
- was when user is login then its redirect to browse page .
- when user is logout then it redirect to sign-out page .

-------------
How we are solving it ?
- we are authenticate eact render in oath event
- now we will do it it in header bcs header is called in every render .
